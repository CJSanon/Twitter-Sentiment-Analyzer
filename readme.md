# Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

## Project Description
A user logs into the application and can search tweets with given keywords; returned tweets are shown with a color for sentiments.. 


## How It Works
Currently this project uses Twitter OAuth to log a user into the application. The user can then enter a word or phrase into a search box which searches Twitter using the word or phrase. Text from tweets are analyzed using a sentiment analyzer API. Tweets are displayed and color coded based on their sentiment.

## Vision for Project
- Pull Tweets, write to S3, schedule with Airflow.
