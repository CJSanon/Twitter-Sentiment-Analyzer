# Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

## Vision for Project
- Pull Tweets, write to S3, schedule with Airflow.
- Upon completion, enrich data with sentiment analyzer (will brainstorm other ways to add on to Twitter trends; news tracker?), write results to a database (determine schema).
- Make a view on that table in the database and display a dashboard of sentiment trends over various periods of time.
